# solconomy
A very incomplete "game" written in Python with Pyglet and Glooey. I've stopped working on it for now and felt like sharing my code for those that would like an example.

#Features:

* Multiplayer (by yourself) with dedicated server and clients.
* Explore Infinite procedurally generated world
* Collecting resources and moving blocks
* Movement and collision on a tilemap
* Main menu and scene switching
* Multi-threading
