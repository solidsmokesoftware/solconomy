Currently the entire tilemap is being simulated by pysics. This is not a very efficent way of doing things but it show what the system can handle

## Features:

* Explore Infinite procedurally generated world
* Destroying blocks and teleportation
* Movement and collision in a physics simulation
* Object-oriented entity management system
* Spatial Hash for entity occlusion


## Instructions:
